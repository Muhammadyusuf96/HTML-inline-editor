I forked and changed the code to work locally. I made these changes:
- removed title
- it can save last changes as draft to `localstorage` and load from it
- changed layout to two column
- added code to prevent page leaving
- added `New file` and `Copy` button
- added checkbox to insert into `body` tag
- added field for entering title
- added tooltips to buttons
- added code beautifier [tidy-html5](http://lovasoa.github.io/tidy-html5/)
- added code highlight [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
